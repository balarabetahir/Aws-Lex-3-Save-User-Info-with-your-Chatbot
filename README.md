# Aws-Lex-4-Save-User-Info-with-your-Chatbot

I'm thrilled to share the latest achievement in my AWS journey! In the fourth installment of my Amazon Lex series, I’ve delved into the fascinating world of context carryover, allowing chatbots to remember user information seamlessly. 🌐



Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:



📬 Context Tag Integration: I implemented a context tag that enables my chatbot to remember a user’s birthday, making interactions more personalized and efficient. 🎂



🆙 New Intent Setup: I established a new intent that handles follow-up balance checks without requiring repeated verification, enhancing user experience and streamlining the process. 💡



🚁 Context Carryover Connection: By linking my context tag with the new intent, I set up a robust context carryover, ensuring a smooth and personalized user journey.



This project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities it opens up for creating intelligent, user-friendly chatbots.
